# Software Development Requirements

## 1. Primary Programming Language

Requirement: The entire application must be developed exclusively using Python.

Constraint: No other programming languages (e.g., JavaScript, C++, Java) are permitted for any part of the application logic or backend.

## 2. Frontend Framework

Requirement: The graphical user interface (GUI) must be implemented using the Flet framework.

Constraint: The use of any other frontend frameworks or libraries (such as React, Vue, Streamlit, or Tkinter) is strictly prohibited. The UI must be built and managed entirely through Python via Flet.

## 3. Architectural Constraints

All components, including state management, navigation, and API integrations, must stay within the Python/Flet ecosystem.

Ensure that all generated code adheres to the official Flet documentation and Python best practices (PEP 8).
